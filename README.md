# PCA_and_Logistic_Regression
This project demonstrates how to fit data using Logistic Regression after applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The goal is to determine the optimal number of principal components required to retain at least 90% of the variance in the dataset, ensuring a balance between model performance and computational efficiency.
